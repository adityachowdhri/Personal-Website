    <p>Do you ever read, see, or hear something and as everyone else glosses over it (or also notices it) you think to yourself "wow." You can't articulate it but whatever was said just stuck with you. The problem for me is i often forget these things, so I wanted to create an archive on my website. Enjoy (or dont).</p>

        <p>"Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget the smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky.

        Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever.
        
        Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never." - Elie Wiesel </p>
